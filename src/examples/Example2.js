/**************************************************************************************************************
 * Only difference between this example and the Example1 is Decoration component that used on Counter component.
 * In this example, decoration is a just component in Counter Component. It doesn't depend on state as count.
 * But it re-renders! Interesting... ---> So there are 2 things that we should understand <---
 **************************************************************************************************************
 * 1- When a component re-renders, it tries to re-render all descendants,
 * regardless of whether they're being passed a particular state variable through props or not. But why?
 * ---> Here's the answer: it's hard for React to know, with 100% certainty,
 * whether <Decoration> depends, directly or indirectly, on the count state variable. <---
 **************************************************************************************************************
 * 2- Our <BigCountNumber> component isn't re-rendering because the count prop changed.
 * When a component re-renders, because one of its state variables has been updated,
 * that re-render will cascade all the way down the tree, in order for React to
 * fill in the details of this new sketch, to capture a new snapshot.
 * ---> So, PROPS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RE-RENDERS! <---
