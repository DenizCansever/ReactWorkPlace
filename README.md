# React Workplace 


In this repository you will see my code examples for specific topics in React.    



## Topics
There are seperated topics that are written below. If you click on the topic, you will see the article that inspired me about React concepts which I haven't focused that much. Topic names are the same as branch names which you can see my code examples in that specific branch.

 - [why-react-re-renders](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/why-react-re-renders)
 - [usememo-usecallback](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/usememo-and-usecallback)

## TODO List
Links that I share below, are on my Todo List. I would like to make big project to adapt some ideas from these sources.   
For developers who are new to React, I highly recommend to check these links to understand fundamental concepts. 

 - [The React Handbook](https://thevalleyofcode.com/react/)
 - [Common UseState Mistakes](https://refine.dev/blog/common-usestate-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid/)
